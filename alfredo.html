    <h1>Amazing Shrimp Alfredo Recipe!</h1>
    <img src="alfredo.jpeg">
    <p>This Shrimp Alfredo Fettuccini is a <strong>major</strong> comfort food. Thereâ€™s just 
          something about a mountain of pasta consumed by rich creamy 
          sauce, and studded with large, tender shrimp that has my 
          name written all over it. It reminds me of my favorite dish
           at Olive Garden; seafood Alfredo.
